# Instacast Remote Buddy Behavior #


This is a REALLY quick and dirty RemoteBuddy Scripted Behavior for Instacast Mac.

## Why?

Because. 

## Requires

- Mac OS X, why? BECAUSE.
- Remote Buddy, current version
- Instacast Mac 1.0

## QuickStart

- Download the zip of the rule. Clone at your peril.
- Import into Remote Buddy
- Enjoy

### Usage

Basic MPlayer type Remote to Instacast bindings:

Up → Volume Up
Down → Volume Down

Left → 30 sec back
Right → 30 sec forward

Space → Play/Pause
Space held down → Switch to/from MiniPlayer

Supports the RB 'Ajax Remote' iOS App and the Apple IR Remote. Nothing else, but the actions are there.

### Workarounds

This is quick/dirty. Probably VERY half assed but works for me.

### Warranties

NONE. This was cooked up in LESS an hour. Use as thou wilt. Works for me, YMMV.
